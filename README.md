# Signup and login using flask

**To Clone The Repository**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/suyogdahal/flask-signup-login.git
```

**Installation**

Install with pip:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```
**To run the app**
```
 First change app config "IMAGE_UPLOADS" at app.py to your local folder name
 This is because by using standard Flask stuff, there's no way to avoid saving a temporary file if the uploaded file size is > 500kb. 

$ python app.py 

```
